# 🌱 Showcasing My Contributions: Soil Nutrient Prediction for Smallholder Farmers in Bangladesh 🚜

Welcome to my repository! This project highlights **my contributions** to an **AI-driven soil nutrient prediction initiative** aimed at empowering smallholder farmers in Bangladesh. As part of a collaborative team of **50 AI engineers from around the world**, I worked on developing machine learning models to predict **Soil Organic Carbon (SOC)**, **Zinc**, and **Boron** levels. These predictions help farmers optimize fertilizer use, improve crop yields, and promote sustainable agricultural practices. 🌾💧

## 📖 **Project Context**

This project was part of an **8-week Omdena-IPAGE challenge**, where a global team collaborated to tackle a critical problem in agriculture. Below is an overview of the project and my role in it.

### 🎯 **The Problem**
Smallholder farmers in Bangladesh face significant challenges due to the lack of precise soil nutrient data, particularly for micro-nutrients like **Boron** and **Zinc**, as well as **Soil Organic Carbon (SOC)**. Current soil testing technologies focus mainly on macronutrients (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium), leaving gaps in data that are essential for optimal fertilizer use. This leads to:

- **Suboptimal Crop Yields** 🌱➖  
- **Environmental Harm** 🌍⚠️ (e.g., water pollution, greenhouse gas emissions)  
- **Economic Inefficiency** 💸📉  
- **Barriers to Sustainable Agriculture** ♻️🚧  

### 🌟 **The Solution**
Our team developed an **AI-driven predictive system** that uses existing soil data to predict missing nutrient levels (SOC, Boron, Zinc) and provides **comprehensive fertilizer recommendations**. By integrating predictive analytics into portable soil testing devices, we aimed to:

- **Enhance Crop Yields** 🌾📈  
- **Reduce Environmental Impact** 🌱🌍  
- **Improve Economic Efficiency for Farmers** 💰✅  
- **Promote Sustainable Farming Practices** ♻️👨‍🌾

## 🛠️ **My Contributions**

In this collaborative project, I focused on the following tasks:

1. **Data Preprocessing and Analysis** 📊  
   - Cleaned and preprocessed soil sensor data for model training.  
   - Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify key trends and patterns.  

2. **Model Development** 🤖🧠  
   - Developed machine learning models to predict SOC, Boron, and Zinc levels.  
   - Experimented with various algorithms (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) to optimize performance.  

3. **Model Validation** 🔧🧪  
   - Evaluated model performance using metrics like RMSE and R².  
   - Collaborated with the team to refine models based on validation results.  

4. **Visualization and Reporting** 📊📝  
   - Created visualizations to communicate model results and insights.  
   - Contributed to the final project report and documentation.
